.. important::  MillRight assumes the control box will be at the back left of the machine.   Any other placement will require extension of the wires.

The connectors are call 4 pin airplane connectors which only go in one way to the sockets.  Simply insert each cable in the socket and screw down the shield to firmly attach it to the controller.
