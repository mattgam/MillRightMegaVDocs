   The completed lead screw Sub-Assembly

There is a lock nut in the anti-backlash nut as well as a grub screw.  The grub screw controls how much resistance the anti-backlash 
nut will impose as the lead screw is turned. The lock nut is then tightened to fix the resistance level in place  

1. Take the lead screw and screw the anti-backlash nut down the screw shaft until it is about centered

.. warning:: An overly tight anti-backlash nut is a common source of problems in Z-Axis movement

2. Hold the anti-backlash nut in one hand and insert an Allen key into the lead screws base.  While Derek doesn’t provide torque ratings 
he does state that you should not have to strain to turn the lead screw but you should feel a little resistance.  If you shake the assembly 
the lead screw shouldn’t feel sloppy i.e. shake around in the socket.

3. Once you have the grub screw at the right level of level of tightness use the needle nose pliers to tighten up the locking nut an lock 
the grub screw in place.
