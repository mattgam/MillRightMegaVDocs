Section 3: 3D Prints to Make Your Life Easier
==============================================

Section 3a: Introduction
------------------------

3D Printers are a game changer in the CNC and Tinkerer space.  While the artistic prints get all the press, the reality is
that these machines are the Yin (Additive Manufacturing) to the Yang (Reductive Manufacturering) of the CNC world.  The ability 
to make complex jigs and tools to assist with the operation of a CNC is invaluable.  As an added benefit if a toolpath should 
can an encounter between an :term:`endmill` and a jig, your expensive endmill won't be destroyed as it reduces the jig to chips.  

3D models for printing can be made in Fusion360 as well as other CAD tools which is a great way to learn the design side of the platform.

2 of the most popular sites to find premade 3D prints for free are:

* https://www.thingiverse.com

Section 3b: 3D Printers
-----------------------

..  todo:: Grab links  to these and check on other models people use

The following are 3D printers in common use by members of the community in ascending order of price.

.. note:: Used printers come up on FaceBook Marketplace, Woot, Craigslist and Ebay all the time.  Black Friday sales are also a great time to get a good deal on many brands including Prusa's.

* Ender 3 Pro -
    Chinesium in all its wonderous glory you can regularly find these on sale in low $200's.  Out of the box tuning will be required 
    to get quality prints and most people upgrade various components to improve print quality but it is a great starter printer and 
    you can't beat the price.
* Crealty (kickstarter) -
    Essentially the Ender 3 prebuilt with all the major upgrades the community regularly applies to the Ender 3
* Prusa Mini -
    Prusa is a top prosumer brand in the 3D printing area and comes at a premium price.  The mini is their latest entry into the field at
    a lower cost with a somewhat reduced initial cost.
* Prusa IMKS3 - 
    Prusa's flagship 3D printer that once dialed in is a workhorse.  The authors regularly runs 20 hours a day with no issues.

Section 3c: Dust Boots
----------------------

..  todo:: Grab pics of each of these

* `OffAxis Labs Dust Boot <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3796339>`_
    By far the most commonly used dust boot by community members. It fits right off the printer and gets  the job done.  Make sure when ordering the hardware from McMaster Carr that you get the 2" bristles.
* `PwnCNC Dust Boot v2 <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3963258>`_
    The owner of PwnCNC has recently purchased a Mega V and will be updating his design for a clean integration 
* `MillRight Mega V Kickstart Dust Shoe 2.5" ShopVac Adapter <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4214864>`_
    For those who modified the Aluminium Kickstarter boot to actually be usable this adapter lets you attach it to a standard 2.5" ShopVac hose.

Section 3d: Workholding/Clamps
------------------------------

Is there really such a thing as too many clamps?  With a 3D printer a wonderland of workholding obsession awaits you.  

..  todo:: Grab pics of each of these

* `CNC push clamps <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4531412>`_
* `CNC hold down clamps <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4510198>`_
* `CNC toe clamps <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4149995>`_
* `PwnCNC Lever Clamp v2 <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3763601>`_
* `PwnCNC Lever Clamp v3 <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4345617>`_
* `PwnCNC Push Clamps <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4441318>`_

Section 3e: Wasteboard Upgrades and Helpers
-------------------------------------------

..  todo:: Grab pics of each of these

* PwnCNC v2 Fences - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4569288
* PwnCNC Tramming Arm - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4128469
* Aluminium support bracket -  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sfMcJPVNfyIrnMTqEWTM5n1eYfVPfvOw/view?usp=sharing
    For use in securing the MillRight Center T-Track Support as well as add on :ref:`Aluminium Extrusion<aluminium_extrusion>` more robustly.  
    There are metal versions of these that can also be bought online if you don't want to use 3D printed ones. <TODO, get permission from John Grissom to post this on Thingiverse>

Section 3f: Limit Switch Alternative Mounts
-------------------------------------------

..  todo:: Grab pics of each of these

* `MillRight Mega V Z Switch Mount <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4310871>`_
    This mount assumes you are using a different limit switch than what came with the Mega V.  You would need to solder wires to the NO and GND pins on 1 of the `Antrader SS-5GL2 SPDT Long Hinge Roller 1NO 1NC Momentary Micro Limit Mini Switch 3 Pins Pack of 6 <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CGZBRPC/>`_

* `Limit Switch Mount for MillRight Mega V <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4318331>`_
    An alternative to the mounts that MillRight shipped with this design is fully compatible with the switches in the Homing Kit.  Print a mirror of it so it can be used on both X and Y switches.

Section 3g: EndMill Helpers
---------------------------

* `PwnCNC Collar Set Jig <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4542353>`_
    See this YouTube video by Chris Powell which inspired the jig `Free CNC Router BitSetter Touch Plate Alternative <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ns1lNJyaYI>`_. 
    The collars used by the jig can be bought on ebay at the `Zoro Tools Store <https://www.ebay.com/itm/CLIMAX-METAL-PRODUCTS-1C-025-Shaft-Collar-Clamp-1Pc-1-4-In-Steel/333269859861>`_. I had great service from this sell.

* `CNC pen holders for Dewalt DWP611 mount <https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/28455>`_

* `MillRight Mega V touch plate holder and magnetic probe <https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/30072>`_
    See the :ref:`Conductive Epoxy <conductive_epoxy>` section for some expensive but handy conductive glue as an alternative to soldering the magnet on.

Section 3h: Filament
--------------------

Not all filament is created equally in quality and even high end filament doesn't work the  same on all brands of machines.  As with everything test before buying in bulk.  

Filament Vendors:
`````````````````
I've had the  most consistent results on my Prusa IMKS3 using:

* Prusa's House Brand -  Prusament
    You can get Prusament on Amazon but its more than double the price of buying direct from Prusa.   DHL gives fairly rapid deliveries from Poland so keep that in mind.
 
* `Atomic Filament PLA and PETG <http://atomicfilament.com>`_

Specific Colors: 
````````````````
The topic of where to get certain colors of filament comes up fairly often.  Let's face it, who doesn't want their machine to look cool when people see it!

* Yellow PlA 
* Dewalt Yellow PlA
* Makita Blue PLA
* Gunmetal Grey PETG
