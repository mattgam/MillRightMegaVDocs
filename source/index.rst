Welcome to MillRight Mega V's Assembly Documentation!
=====================================================

This project was created as a community generated written guide to assembling the
Mega V CNC. MillRight has published 2 video tutorials:

 * `Assembly Video 1 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkZot-WJXo8>`_
 * `Assembly Video 2 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbYK1Pekhf0>`_

While these videos are excellent reference materials not everyone (including the author) likes video guides.
If more help is needed or you just want to tell the world about your successes there are several popular forums:

 * `MillRight's Forums <https://millrightcnc.proboards.com/>`_
 * `Facebook MillRight CNC Mega V Group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/1006388983068312/>`_
 * `Facebook MillRight CNC Users Group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/243620779833403/>`_
