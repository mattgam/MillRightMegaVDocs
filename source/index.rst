Welcome to MillRight Mega V's Assembly Documentation!
=====================================================

This project was created as a community written guide to assembling the
Mega V CNC machine. MillRight has published 2 video tutorials but few written
manual's for builing and operating their Mega V design:

 * `Assembly Video 1 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkZot-WJXo8>`_
 * `Assembly Video 2 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbYK1Pekhf0>`_

While these videos are excellent reference materials not everyone (including the author) likes video guides.
If more help is needed or you just want to tell the world about your successes there are several popular forums:

 * `MillRight's Forums <https://millrightcnc.proboards.com/>`_
 * `Facebook MillRight CNC Mega V Group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/1006388983068312/>`_
 * `Facebook MillRight CNC Users Group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/243620779833403/>`_
