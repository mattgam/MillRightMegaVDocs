Section 5: Universal G-Code Sender
==================================

Section 5a: Introduction
------------------------

This is the default g-code sender for the Mega V. MillRight made a custom version of it to add support for their 4th axis. 
You will see this version referred to as the MillRIght UGS or some variant of that and can be downloaded from their resources 
page. Being custom to MillRight this version is a frozen in time snapshot of UGS from February 2020. The normal UGS that only 
supports 3 Axis milling has continued development and can be downloaded from https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/#downloads. 
This is referred to as the "Nightly Build" of UGS which literally means it includes all changes to the Software as of that day. 
Certain features were broken when millright made there version like the homing plate which now work in the recent updates to 
the nightly build. If you aren't using the 4th Axis you can use the Nightly build to access these features. You can install 
both onto your computer safely. UGS also runs on Windows, Macs, and Linux.
