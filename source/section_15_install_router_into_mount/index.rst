.. note::  The router power cable looks like you could route it in the drag change.  Don't do it!  
           The power flowing to the router can cause signal noise in the homing sensors and other electronics.  Keep them far apart.



Section 15c: Initial squaring and tramming
------------------------------------------

1. Take a speed square and place it on the bed

2. Position the square on the front of the router and then each side and verify the router is at a right angle to the bed

.. note:: Brad Ellerbroek's tramming plate is a big help with this and was mentioned in :ref:`Brad`.

3. If it isn't square loosen the pinch bolt and reseat the router then tighten the pinch bolt

.. warning:: This can be a maddening process that takes a lot of time if you try to be a perfectionist.

4.  Derek mentions a tramming video on the MillRight boards.  It can be found `here <https://millrightcnc.proboards.com/thread/1468/tram-spindle-on-cheap>`_

5. As an alternative to Derek's instructions in the video, Winston Moy has a great tramming video for a competing CNC but its totally applicable to the Mega V.  Please watch it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGOGlNurglE

6. I found this video on CNCNuts recently which I found helpful in tramming `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pfIoyhgTc`_
