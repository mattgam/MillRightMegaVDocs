Section 2b: Notes before beginning
``````````````````````````````````

.. note:: Gantry plates have sides to them. For the Left and Right Gantry plates there are 2 holes just above
         the center of each plate.  On one side of the plate will be a pocket wider than the hole going full penetration.
         This is the side the V-Wheels are installed on.  ** DO NOT ** install the V-Wheels on the side without the pocket or
         you’ll be redoing your work.

.. note:: The tops of the Left and right and right gantry plates have the hex slopes to them and the bottom side is square

.. note:: In any mechanical device that will undergo vibration it is a good idea to use loktite on each
          screw to glue it in place and lesson the chance of it working it's way loose over time.  Only use BLUE
          loktite https://www.amazon.com/Loctite-QuickStix-442-37684-Thread-Treatment/dp/B000132VH6 on the Mega V’s screws.
          Red requires a torch to break its bond and you will just strip out the screws trying to remove them.  In the video
          Derek instructs you to loosely secure all the components of the gantry plate first.  We don’t recommend using loktite
          until you are ready for final tightening or you may have it dry and bind the screw before you are ready for final tightening.
